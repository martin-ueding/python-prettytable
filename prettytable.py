python-prettytable
##################

Python's ``str`` class provides the ``rjust``, ``ljust`` and ``center``
functions that can be used to print a table.

This module provides a simple interface to create a pretty table.

Call it with::

	import prettytable

	prettytable.print_table(headers, data, margin=2, outfile=None)

``headers`` is a list of objects, ``data`` is a list of rows, which are lists of
objects, one for each table cell.

If you need more margin between the columns, use the ``margin`` option.

``outfile`` is set to standard out by default, you can set it to any file like
object that has a ``write`` method.

sample output
=============

This is a sample output::

	Dir  Name   Last                        Difference
	---  ----   ----                        ----------
